# fireboy-and-watergirl-source
An unofficial repository that has the extracted source files, and EXEs of all of the first 4 Fireboy &amp; Watergirl games.


# Layout
Each version (Forest, Light, Ice, Crystal) has a folder that contains all of the extracted assets from the provided game file (.swf) inside that folder

# Usage
Just download the exe you need and run it!
The .exe files are completely unedited, but I plan on releasing versions where ads/splashscreens are removed
Any issues? Let me know through my contacts,and I'll try to help:
