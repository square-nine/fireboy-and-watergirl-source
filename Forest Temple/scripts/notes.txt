Terms:
Copy -> Copy text AND ADJUST for new variables/constants
Modify -> Add to that specific line data needed.

Parts to change to add a new character:

Game.as: Needing to add inputs (3 inputs: up, left, right)
Add from line 721 code similar to the range 730-732, that is, a "case [keyCodeValue]:", then set a variable to True, then break
Add from line 742 "[varName] = False;", to make sure there definetely no input

Needing to handle the removing of keyPressed
Add from line 870 code similar to the range 871-873, that is, a "case [keyCodeValue]:", then set a variable to False, then break

level.as: Needing to add character creation, and also processing of inputs + animation. Might also need to add a finishing door, but that can come later

REQUIRED:
NEw declared variables:
Copy line 41 (allowJump: bool)
Copy line 63 (prohibJump: bool)
Copy lines 75,81, 109 (Left, Up, Right variables: bool)
Copy line 135 (person: b2Body)

level() config:
Copy line 179-181 with Up, Left, Right defaulting to zero at every initialisation

CHAR CREATION:
Copy lines 803-835 for a FireBoy base, and lines 836-868 for a WaterGirl base
Explanation of key variables:
Density -> How much to weigh per UNIT AREA, 2D game after all. Think laminas.
Friction -> self-explanatory
Restitution -> how elastic is collision
localPosition -> Where to center the hitbox
fixedRotation -> Don't rotate this
userData -> Character-specific creator (use self-created one)
userData.filters -> used to all a glowing effect (defo do)
position -> Set the position right away

Three types of creation/hitboxes: Creating the head (called pers1/2) and the legs (called fire/waterLegs) and the torso (rect)

Modify line 1199 for a third person; not sure why "Tuting" is needed but oke
Copy lines 1211-1215 to set visibility of all sprites to zero. These get toggled on/off depending if running, standing, jumping up, falling, or heading up stairs

Copy lines 1221-1369 to add controls.
More specifically:
1221-1223 -> Setting variables
1224-1231 -> Registering collisions
1232-1235 -> Check if the sprite is on the ground
1236-1280 -> If they cannot jump (hence in air), calculate where they are facing and set a different sprite/facing
1281-1299 -> L/R Movement sprite setting, or if not moving then set to the stationary sprite
1300-1347 -> If L/R key is held and not at max speed, then accelerate
1348-1358 -> If no key is held, then decelerate person
1359-1365 -> IF you can jump due to location and controls, and U is pressed, play jump sound, prohibit jump and accelerate upwards
1366-1369 -> If jump isn't pressed, don't prohibit jump

Copy lines 1698-1706 to add ded handling, by pausing, ending, play ded animation and removing character.

Modify 218-763 so that there is also a start point for your person, kinda important, or just copy an existing one to be safe.

OPTIONAL:
Starting Position
New declared variables:
Copy Line 33 (StartPos: b2Vec2)

Gems:
New declared variables:
Copy line 45 (BDCount: Number) (counts gems?)

Jump sound:
New declared variables:
Copy line 95 (J1: JumpSound)
Copy line 186 (J1 set to a new JumpSound)
Copy line 1361 into controls to add the new jump sound.

Finish door:
New declared variables:
Copy line 111 (DoorChannel; SoundChannel) (doorSounds)
Copy line 195 (initialisation of DoorChannel)
Modify line 1103 to add a third parameter for a new finish
Copy lines 1134-1154 to actually create the third door
Copy lines 1613-1616 to add a new door thing to check for
Copy lines 1621-1666 to do more stuff
Modify the other door scripts (1621-1697) to add the extra door to check for. GL figuring that out lol
